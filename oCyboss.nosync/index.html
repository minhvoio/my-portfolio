        <h2>ü¶æ Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          oCyboss is a unique collection representing the equality of human beings. Each NFT is a one-of-a-kind jewel of 2,222 oCyboss based on the Solana blockchain.        
        </p>
        <p>
          The changes of cyborgs stand for our message to the world: "No one left behind".
          When it comes to our messages for now and for the future, we laser focus on enhancing people‚Äôs awareness about giving others a hand in any situation. 
        </p>

        <p>
          We desire to build The One Club of Protagonists and Innovators who will contribute and profit from our state-of-the-art Metaverse. 
          This also aligns the arts, web 3.0, and appreciably more with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to advocate for others and innovate an even brighter world. 
        </p>

        <h2>üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ Why should I buy this NFT?</h2>
        
        <p>
          With regard to oCyboss, we will donate 10% of the revenue to advocate for the handicapped and war victims through the United Nations Joint SDG Fund.
          We will also donate 10% of revenue based on the voting result in the One Club.
        </p>

        <p>
          oCyboss is not only the beginning of our adventure but also a foundation, a key to our Metaverse that will be exclusively dedicated to Protagonists and Innovators. 
          Your oCyboss doubles as your The One Club membership card, and you will grant access to member-only benefits for all our future projects. This includes FREE Airdrops, FREE Premium Softwares,  Whitelisting (with at least 50% discount), Voting, and remarkable benefits that will be unlocked along the journey.
        </p>

        <p>
          The most intriguing part of our cutting-edge Metaverse, the Oneverse, will be your ability to build, profit, and contribute to a better world.
        </p>

        <p>
          Are you ready to become The One?

        <h2>üåü Membership Utilities</h2>

        <h3>1. Membership Utilities</h3>
        <p>
          Discord is where our community connects. Members can get the "The One" role which grants them access to our member-only channels. This includes the Mental Health channel, FREE Premium Software channel, Exclusive Airdrop channel, meetup channels, and more!         
        </p>
        <h3>2. Exclusive Airdrop</h3>
        <p>
          Only OCyboss NFT V1 holders are eligible to participate in our two main airdrop events including:
          <p>1. oCyboss Token Airdrop</p> 
          <p>2. oCyboss NFT V2 Airdrop</p>       
        </p>

        <h3>3. Lifetime Premium Free!</h3>
        <p>We are rolling out a lifetime free program for our members with access to helpful resources for navigating in web3 and all projects developed by our company in the future.</p>
        <p><strong>For more details:</strong></p>
        <p>Within 2 days of oCyboss Prelaunch Day, the more oCyboss sold, the longer the benefits hold:</p>
        <p>‚Ä¢ 111 oCyboss sold - Each member will get 1 year of using free any Premium Software from our Founder (if there is any).</p>
        <p>‚Ä¢ 222 oCyboss sold - Each member will get 2 years of using free any Premium Software from our Founder (there will be 1 or 2 softwares release).</p>
        <p>‚Ä¢ 555 oCyboss sold - Each member will get 5 years of using free any Premium Software from our Founder (there will be many softwares release).</p>
        <p>‚Ä¢ 1,111 oCyboss sold - Each member will get a Lifetime of using free any Premium Software from our Founder (there will be many many softwares release).</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> This would mean that if our company failed, you still can keep your benefits as long as you still hold your oCyboss and be in our The One Club. This merit will be offered only for this oCyboss Project.</p>
        <p><strong>Why this offer?</strong></p>
        <p>I know this offer may sound huge, but we do need your sponsor to support Minh Vo, the founder of this project, in studying abroad and getting his master's degree in Artificial Intelligence. Your support would mean the world to him as he wants to innovate software to contribute to a better world.</p>

        <h3>4. Giveaway & Promotion</h3>
        <p>We will be selecting a few projects each month to collaborate with. Our collaboration will closely align with our core values, mission, and vision. This collaboration will bring huge benefits and opportunities for The One members such as the chance to receive many gifts from other NFT projects, and more!</p>
        
        <h3>5. Welcome to Onverse Metaverse!</h3>
        <p>All oCyboss NFT owners will have access to the Onverse Metaverse for free. Members can build a virtual Oneverse world together and transact using oCyboss Token to buy goods and services in the Oneverse Metaverse.</p>

        <h3>6. Spread Positivity</h3>
        <p>We will donate 10% of the revenue to advocate for the handicapped and war victims through the United Nations Joint SDG Fund.</p>
        <p>Moreover, each month we will select individuals/organizations to support based on your votes, and recommendations (but of course, your choice will have to align with the core values of our project).</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> All funding information will be public. The support program will end when the total amount of funding reaches 10% of the total project revenue.</p>
